# User Stories Directory

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive user stories for the AirBnB Clone project, derived directly from the use case diagram analysis. These user stories serve as the bridge between high-level requirements and detailed implementation tasks.

## üìÅ Directory Contents

### Files

## üéØ Purpose of User Stories

User stories serve multiple critical purposes in our development process:

1. **Requirements Translation** - Convert technical use cases into user-focused narratives
2. **Development Planning** - Provide clear, implementable tasks for development teams
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - Define specific conditions that must be met for completion
4. **Sprint Planning** - Enable accurate estimation and prioritization
5. **Testing Foundation** - Provide basis for test case development
6. **Stakeholder Communication** - Offer clear, business-focused requirement descriptions

## üìä User Stories Structure

### Format
Each user story follows the standard format:
```
As a [role]
I want [goal/desire]
So that [benefit/value]
```

### Components
